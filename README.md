## Practice problems with examples in C++:
+ [PassbyValueandPassbyReference](PassbyValueNbyReferenExample.cpp) is good example that clarifies the passbyvalue and passbyreference in function. 
+ [PointerFunctionPassingArray](practice/PointerFunctionReturnArray.cpp) gives the crystal clear idea about passing array in function and how to use pointer. Please    go over this code to figure out the idea. Run this code in your computer. 
+ [ClassExample](ClassExample) has basic examples of class, constructor, and destructor.  
+ [1Dising-Model](1Dising-Model) is another big example to understand the class in c++
+ [Call-member-function-to-non-member-function](Call_member_to_non_member_function) is an example to show how to call member function to non member function.
+ [SomeAlgorithms](SomeAlgorithms) has some basic algorithms used with examples. 
+ [RecursiveExamples](RecursiveExamples) has some basic recursive function examples.
+ [OperatorOverloading](OperatorOverloading) This contains the example of operator overloading in c++.
