# Why Class in C++ ?
* This example gives a sort of idea about the necessity of the class.
* 5 students informations are given. We will need to sort the students by name, then sort them by number, and finally sort them by graduation date. This is an example from [Udacity](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud210/lessons/e90ff59d-4e98-4ebf-9da7-8d28ed7636a3/concepts/50cc2c10-2bac-49f0-97fe-bdbb73336198).
+ student1: Name: Joe Lime, ID#15, Grad. Date: 2019
+ student2: Name: Bob Green, ID#3, Grad. Date: 2020
+ student3: Name: SallyAnne Green , ID#1, Grad. Date: 2017
+ student4: Name: Annie Blue, ID#10, Grad. Date: 2020
+ student5: Name: Jose Lemon, ID#25, Grad. Date: 2016
## `C++ Convention is:`
  + Capitalize the first letter of the classname
  + Private members are listed first. If you do this, there is no need to use the 'private' keyword. If you list them after the public keyword, you will need to identify them using the private keyword.
  + Use 'getVariableName' for accessing private variables Use 'setVariableName' for assigning values to private variables
  + You will need to signify that the functions are part of the class definition by using the namespace classname::.
  + For more clarification go to the other examples here in the [examples](https://github.com/Kindiras/C_plus_plus/tree/master/ClassExample)
  + see the solution of above problem using class [solution](goodexampleclass.cpp) and this solution is modified and written in more professional way not copied the solution from the sources.
