## C++ OOP:
* As the beginner in the Object Oriented Programmer I have done some examples. 

`Lesson 1`
   + Constructor is not made.
   + class1.cpp is a basic example of make class in the c++.
   + It will ask name and other information and give the output. 
   
`Lesson 2`
   + This is an example with constructor.
   +It is the modification of the previous example with constructor. 
   
`Lesson 3`
   + Here the destructor is also used. 
   + Destructure is same name as constructor with `~` in it.
   + Used for releasing any resources allocated by object.
